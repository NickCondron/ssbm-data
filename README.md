# ssbm-data

`ssbm-data` is a repository for static data relating to [Super Smash Bros. Melee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee), such as character & stage enum constants. The data resides in hand-written [JSON files](./resources), but we also auto-generate a Rust library to provide seamless access to this data. Libraries for other languages may follow, depending on demand.
